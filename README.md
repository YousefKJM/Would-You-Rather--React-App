# Would-You-Rather--React-App

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

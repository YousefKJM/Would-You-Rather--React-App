# Would-You-Rather-React-App

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In nutshell, Would You Rather is a fully responsive and mobile-ready polling game that presents the user with a series of questions.

It's built with React, Redux, React Router, & Redux Thunk.
